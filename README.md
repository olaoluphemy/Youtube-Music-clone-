# Youtube-Music-clone-
A youtube music web app landing page clone, done by me (using just HTML and CSS) to showcase my progress so far with css3 and html5
It involved the use of basic html tags, and appliations of basic css properties.
Some of which include flexbox, the hover property, position property/transform property
Practical apllications/styling of certain Pseudo selectors, rgba color scheme and many more
